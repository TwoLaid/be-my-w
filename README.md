###Please provide a short description of your application
With `BeMyW` every shared BMW becomes your BMW. When you arrive at the car the drivers seat and mirrors are already adjusted, your radio stations are configured and your destination is  shown in the navigation system. Get in, press start and enjoy the ride!

`BeMyW` is the remote control for your shared BMWs. On cold days you can set the heater to a cozy temperatur and warm your seat before arriving at your vehicle. Also why not schedule a list of calls you want to do while driving in advance?

`BeMyW` is a cloud based web-app for smartphones. After reserving the desired car via a car sharing provider users have access to their automobiles. Most settings (e.g. seat and mirror-settings) are carried over from the last drive and therefore allow easy switching of cars. It is also possible to view and adjust these settings with the app. The application is accessible both on android and iOS or any other Webbrowser.

###Please list the APIs and data sets you used
* CarAPI

Due to the futurist approach of the app most of the functions are not available through the CarAPI. Therefore we implemented a Car-Simulator to demonstrate these functions.
